# aoproxy
A simple degrader proxy written for an amiga forum that had issues with legacy amiga browsers.

Written on PHP 5.3 and above during lunch breaks and no way intended as an example of how to write good code. Uses a very dumb mirror structure of the forum in which each index page invokes a proxying and rewriting action. This should be replaced with some basic rewrite rules but I could never be bothered.
